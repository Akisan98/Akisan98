I'm a software developer that finished my studies this December and are looking for work. 

### üõ†Ô∏è Projects

[**Binge - Android & iOS (Flutter - Dart) | Currenly Working on**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ml.akisan.binge)

**["API Server" - Flask](https://github.com/Akisan98/flask_api)** | I Created a small "Dummy" API Server based on Flask (Python), so i could try to create a REST/ REST-like API. Example at [api.akisan.ml](https://api.akisan.ml/) 

<p style="font-size: 0.6rem;">Due to my hosting provider only allowing static pages to live example is static while the code is "real / dynamic".  (This can be expanded by connecting to a DB vs. hard coded data)</p>

**[My Shows - Android (Kotlin)](https://github.com/Akisan98/encrypted/tree/master/My%20Shows)** | My Shows keeps track of all the shows you watch and how far you have progressed, so you don't need to keep guessing anymore! This application is currently being rewritten / restructured to remove bad code and its dependency on website of iMDb.

**[My website - HTML & CSS](https://www.akisan.ml/)** | My first website in HTML. It s a place to showcase my work and to learn HTML, by implementing things as I learn more. Live example at [www.akisan.ml](https://www.akisan.ml/) 

**[Mist - Android (Kotlin)](https://github.com/Akisan98/encrypted/tree/master/Mist)** | Group Project at UiO, the Project was to represent data from meteorological institute in a user-friendly way in form of an Android app.

##### Proof of Concepts:

**[Happy Food (Android)](https://github.com/Akisan98/encrypted/tree/master/Happy%20Food/Android)** | Happy Foods helps you keep you body happy, by making it easier to know whether a allergen is present in a product or meal. (Currently aim to target Lactose, Gluten and diabetes)

**[Happy Food (Web Console - Flutter)](https://github.com/Akisan98/encrypted/tree/master/Happy%20Food/Console-Web)** | Web Console enables companies to add, edit and delete data about their products. Live example at [hf.akisan.ml](https://hf.akisan.ml/) (Initial Load of Website Might be Slow, this website was made in Flutter)

### üë∑ Currently Working On

I'm working on a second TV Show tracker, this under the name Binge, this time based on Flutter from the ground up, with a proper API, instead of web scraping; which means no issues with digital rights for images and stability. üòÉ
